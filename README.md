# applied-machine-learning
This is a repository of all projects completed as part of course - DSBA 6165 Applied Machine Learning This is also my journey of learning while experimenting with code. It has links to multiple python notebooks

A logistic regression model of the Iris Dataset with the features Sepal length and Sepal width.  We see a striking difference between Iris Setosa and the other two species of the iris flow(Iris Virginica and Iris Versicolour) as shown in the plots.

Using a dataset that shows if a recipe is a cupcake, muffin or a scone, Support Vector Machine is created to show how these recipes are different when their main ingredients are mapped on a graph. The same dataset is used as input to create a Decision Tree showing what is the percentage of an ingredient to be present in the recipe to be classified as a cupcake, muffin or a scone
